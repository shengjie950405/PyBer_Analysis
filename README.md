- Expand the regional coverage of suburban drivers, enable these drivers to connect the ride among rural and urban area to increase the amount of total rides and cover the the shortage of drivers in rural area.
- Provide more discount to riders to increase the amount of total Rides for increasing ave fare for each driver.
